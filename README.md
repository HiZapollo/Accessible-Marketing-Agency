# Accessible-Marketing-Agency

## Description

This was a project that was meant to teach how to properly create an accessible webpage to optimize it for search engines. It was also used to teach semantic HTML elements, logical structure of code, proper titles, and proper commenting practices. The project was given as a starter code, lacking in each of the areas listed prior, and was meant to be modified to meet these objectives. It was very effective at teaching and giving me experience for each of these areas.
